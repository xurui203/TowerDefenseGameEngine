/**
 * This interface is implemented by the classes CanOccupy and CannotOccupy that
 * are then used as instance variables in the classes that could possibly
 * occupy IOccupiables.  If the unit currently can occupy, it will have an 
 * instance of CanOccupy, otherwise it will have an instance of CannotOccupy.  
 * Using the strategy pattern like this, interactives ability to occupy can be
 * dynamically changed.  For example, a unit may be implemented such that 
 * it can not occupy an IOccupiable until an upgrade is bought.  The unit will 
 * initially have an instance of CannotOccupy but once the upgrade is bought 
 * it will switch to have an instance of CanOccupy.
