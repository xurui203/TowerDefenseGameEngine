/**
 * 
 * This interface is implemented by the classes CanAttack and CannotAttack that
 * are then used as instance variables in the classes that could possibly
 * attack.  If the unit currently can attack, it will have an instance of
 * CanAttack, otherwise it will have an instance of CannotAttack.  Using the
 * strategy pattern like this, units and buildings ability to attack can be
 * dynamically changed.  For example, a worker may be implemented such that 
 * it can not attack until an upgrade is bought.  The worker will initially
 * have an instance of CannotAttack but once the upgrade is bought it will
 * switch to have an instance of CanAttack.
